Write a program that takes a number n as input and prints nth number in Fibonacci series. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and then each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers before it. So, the first few numbers in the series are - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.

Input Format

Read the integer n, which denotes the position in the Fibonacci sequence.

The program efficiently handles large values of 𝑛 using iterative computation.
Output Format

Print the nth Fibonacci number.
Sample Input 0

4
Sample Output 0

2
